# Yu AgentHub

### AI Agent Team Management Platform — Enhanced Fork

Forked from [Stanshy/AgentHub](https://github.com/Stanshy/AgentHub), with significant enhancements in cross-agent communication, execution observability, and intelligent task orchestration.

## What Is This?

An **Electron desktop app** for managing a virtual AI development team powered by Claude Code. Each Agent is a Claude Code CLI session with its own role, skills, and constraints. The platform orchestrates them through Harness Engineering — Skills standardize workflows, Hooks enforce quality, FileWatcher syncs in real-time.

**You are the boss. Agents execute. The system enforces discipline.**

## What's New In This Fork

This fork adds features inspired by **Dify** and **CrewAI**, addressing key gaps in the original:

### Cross-Agent Communication
- **Messages UI** — Full inbox with project/agent/status filters
- **Project-scoped messaging** — Messages isolated per project, no cross-project noise
- **Dual system bridge** — AgentHub SQLite MessageBroker syncs with Claude Code Teams JSON inbox
- **Real-time events** — Messages, task status changes, and delivery all push to UI instantly

### Intelligent Task Orchestration (CrewAI-inspired)
- **Task output chaining** — When Task A completes, its output auto-injects into Task B's system prompt via dependency graph
- **Auto-unlock downstream tasks** — Dependencies all done → downstream task auto-transitions `created → assigned`
- **Sequential execution strategy** — Tasks flow through the dependency DAG automatically

### Execution Observability (Dify-inspired)
- **Cost/token dashboard** — Chart.js visualizations with Line, Doughnut, and Bar charts
- **Per-agent and per-project breakdowns** — See exactly where spend is going
- **Daily trend analysis** — 14-day cost + session count with dual-axis line chart
- **Summary stats** — Total tokens, tool calls, sessions at a glance

### Agent Intelligence
- **Autonomous delegation** — System prompt auto-injects colleague list + SendMessage instructions; agents decide when to delegate
- **Persistent memory** — `agent_memory` table stores key-value context across sessions; auto-loaded on spawn
- **Session output persistence** — `result_summary` captured and stored for both sessions and tasks

### Quality of Life
- **Task cards auto-update** — Full event chain from backend transition to UI (was completely broken)
- **PTY message debounce** — Batches consecutive messages into single writes
- **Content size protection** — 50KB limit prevents PTY buffer overflow
- **PTY error handling** — Graceful fallback when write fails

### Key Services

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| SessionManager | PTY lifecycle, output buffering, auto task transitions |
| MessageBroker | Cross-session messaging with auto-delivery + JSON inbox sync |
| PromptAssembler | System prompt assembly with dependency outputs, memory, colleague injection |
| TaskManager | CRUD, status machine, dependency graph, auto-unlock |
| ProjectSync | chokidar → markdown parser → DB upsert → eventBus |
| HookManager | Tech stack detection, stop-validator, pre-commit checks |

### Data Flow: Task Output Chaining

```
Task A (frontend-dev) completes
  → output_summary stored in DB
  → Task B (test-writer) depends on A
  → Task B spawns → PromptAssembler queries dependencies
  → Task A's output injected as "前置任務輸出" section
  → test-writer has full context of what was built
```
